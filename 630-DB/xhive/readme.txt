X-Hive/DB Major release 7.0.0, 03 Oct 2005

Introduction
------------

This installer provides a version of xhive.jar that works with a JDK 1.4
You can also run the samples with a JDK 1.4
Also all administration tools (XHAdmin, XHServer, etc) work with a JDK 1.4

Part of the sources (the sources of the administrator client) require
a JDK 1.5 to compile them

If you want to use a JDK 1.5 for your own development,
you may be interested in downloading a JDK 1.5 version of the xhive.jar
using the new Java 1.5 language features.

Changes
-------
For full information on the differences between this release
and earlier releases, please review the file changes.txt.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
 - Close all running X-Hive/DB applications.
 - The previous step includes stopping the dedicated database 
   server with XHStopServer (if it is running).
 - If you make backups of your databases, this would be
   a good time to make one (even though the changes made
   with this installation should be non-obstructive).
