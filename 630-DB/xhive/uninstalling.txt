Uninstalling X-hive

Windows:
========
Uninstalling xhive can be done by using the Add/ Remove Programs item in the
Control Panel. The data directories and other remaining files can be removed
'by hand' afterwards.
(You should not simply delete the directory, as X-Hive/DB will unregister 
the dedicated page server service during deinstallation).

Unix:
=====
Uninstalling xhive should be done as following:
- Stop the dedicated page server, if running, with XHStopServer
- Remove the installation and data directories
